Summary:
This is the minor version upgrade of the Splunk support add-on from pervious
version. The new version is based on the ArcSight CEF version 25 (released 
September 28, 2017) with some new features.

In this version:
-  Rename the display name to compliance with the Splunk base app naming convention standards
-  Add the new function which allow the dynamic field extractions form the random 
      additional fields (ad.randomFieldNameWithSpecialCharacters);

      consistent;
-  Enable the field alias of the full names for the ArcSight CEF fields' key names by 
      default;

      time and effort of modifications and customizations;
-  Packaging with the Splunk packaging toolkit with the app.manifest file;
-  Removed the functions of the index time log source renaming;
-  Removed the function calls from the default/props.conf file, which merge two fields' values
      and form the new fields. The functions are still available in the default/transforms.conf
      file, and the users can manually call them out when needed.
-  Removed the additional field aliases which start with the prefix "cef_";
-  Update the relevant documents.
