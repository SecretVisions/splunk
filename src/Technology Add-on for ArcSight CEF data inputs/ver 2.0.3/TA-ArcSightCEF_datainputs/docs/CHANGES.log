Summary:
This is the last version which is compatible with the legacy versions of Splunk
platforms (version 6.5.x and 6.6.x). This version is based on the ArcSight CEF 
version 25 (released September 28, 2017) with some new features.

In this version:
-  Renamed the id from Splunk_SA_cefinput to TA-ArcSightCEF_datainputs
-  Renamed the stanzas in transforms.conf with the prefix "c_" which "c" stands for community
     versions. This will avoid the potential conflicts from the official versions of Splunk 
     ArcSight apps and add-ons.
-  Redesigned the field extractions for the standard CEF fields
-  Added a few new non standard CEF fields
-  Added the non standard CEF fields with multiple values
-  Update the relevant documents.
